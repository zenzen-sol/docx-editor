/**
 * Watermark document API
 *
 * Platform-agnostic helpers for reading and applying a document watermark.
 * Shared by the React and Vue adapters (and the imperative ref API) so the
 * "Design → Watermark" behavior stays identical across frameworks.
 *
 * A watermark lives on `HeaderFooter.watermark`. MS Word repeats the same
 * watermark across the default, first-page, and even-page headers of every
 * section, so `setDocumentWatermark`:
 *
 * 1. Applies the watermark (a per-header copy) to every existing header, and
 * 2. Creates the header parts a section needs but lacks, so the watermark
 *    still shows on title pages (`w:titlePg`) and even pages
 *    (`w:evenAndOddHeaders`) and on documents that had no header at all.
 *
 * To avoid breaking header inheritance (a section that omits a header
 * reference inherits the previous section's header — Word's "link to
 * previous"), a missing `first`/`even` header part is only created when **no**
 * header of that type exists anywhere in the document, i.e. there is nothing to
 * inherit. All updates are immutable — a new `Document` is returned so the
 * change lands in the host's undo/redo history.
 */

 * watermark shows on every page MS Word would show it.
