 * Comment + tracked-change ID allocation.
 *
 * Comments (`w:comment` ids) and tracked changes (`w:ins`/`w:del` revision ids)
 * share a single OOXML ID space — a duplicate ID between the two corrupts the
 * round-trip. Allocation is therefore one monotonic, no-reuse counter, exposed
 * as an **instance-scoped** factory rather than module-global state so two
 * editor instances on one page never share (or collide on) a counter.
 *
 * Kept separate from the comment/tracked-change transaction builders
 * (`commentOps.ts`) so the allocator can be owned independently — the editor
 * engine seeds and threads it without dragging in the PM-text-lookup graph.
