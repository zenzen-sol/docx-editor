/**
 * Create the suggestion-mode ProseMirror plugin. **Must be mounted on
 * the editor view for `setSuggestionMode` and `toggleSuggestionMode`
 * to do anything** — both adapters (`@eigenpal/docx-editor-react`,
 * `@eigenpal/docx-editor-vue`) auto-mount this inside the `DocxEditor`
 * component, so consumers using the bundled components don't need to
 * register it themselves.
 *
 * When active, typed text gets the `insertion` mark, deleted text gets
 * the `deletion` mark (text stays in the doc; the painter strikes it
 * through), Enter sets `pPrIns` on the originating paragraph, and
 * Backspace at paragraph start sets `pPrDel` on the previous paragraph.
 * Author + adjacent same-author marks coalesce into one tracked change.
 *
 * @param initialActive - Whether suggesting mode starts on. Default `false`.
 * @param author - Author name attached to every minted revision. Default `'User'`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createSuggestionModePlugin } from '@eigenpal/docx-editor-core/prosemirror/plugins';
 *
 * const plugin = createSuggestionModePlugin(false, 'Jane');
 * EditorState.create({ doc, plugins: [plugin, ...other] });

/**
 * Single source of tracked-revision ids across the package.
 *
 * Why a shared module-level counter:
 *
 *   - Each `revisionId` is the OOXML `<w:ins w:id="…"/>` attribute. Two
 *     unrelated revisions emitted by the same author with the same id
 *     would silently collapse in the sidebar (grouped by id+author+date)
 *     and on accept (resolved by id), so collisions are observable.
 *   - Pre-refactor, three call sites each kept their own
 *     `Date.now() + offset` counter (suggestionMode.ts, table commands
 *     delete.ts, table commands insert.ts). Offsets made first-load
 *     collisions rare but not impossible — counters drift independently,
 *     and parallel-browser Playwright workers can start from identical
 *     `Date.now()` seeds.
 *
 * Routing every mint through this module guarantees within-realm
 * uniqueness even when callers interleave across plugins, commands, and
 * test harnesses.
 *
 * Re-exported as `@public` through `prosemirror/plugins/index.ts` so
 * adapter integrations (image insertion, custom commands) can mint
 * revision triples without reaching into the implementation directly.

 * suggesting-aware table commands (`addRowBelow`, `deleteRow`, ...). One
 * source of truth for both the mint and the author/date fields.
