 * documentStyles plugin — makes the document's StyleResolver reachable from

 * Styles otherwise flow one way (Document → PM) at load time: `toProseDoc`
 * bakes resolved formatting into nodes and discards the resolver. Some
 * commands need the live style table though — the Enter handler looks up a
 * paragraph style's `w:next` to switch to body text after a heading. This
 * plugin parks the resolver in plugin state so those commands can read it
 * via `getDocumentStyleResolver(state)`.
 *
 * The host (React `HiddenProseMirror` / `HiddenHeaderFooterPMs`, Vue
 * `useDocxEditor`) passes the same styles it hands to `toProseDoc` and adds
 * this plugin when creating the EditorState. When absent, style-aware
 * commands fall back to their style-agnostic behavior.
