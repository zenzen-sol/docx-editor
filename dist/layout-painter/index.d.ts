/**
 * Layout Painter
 *
 * Main entry point for rendering Layout data to DOM.
 * Provides reconciliation for efficient incremental updates.
 *
 * @experimental Stable enough for the first-party React adapter, but the
 * API may change in minor releases until a third-party adapter validates
 * it. Pin a version range if you depend on this directly.
 * @packageDocumentation
 * @public
